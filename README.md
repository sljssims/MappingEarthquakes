Earthquake data was used to visualize information on a map.  Using Leaflet.js API and GeoJSON earthquake data we can provide a visual representation of data on a map for easier viewing.  

Map layerings for all earthquakes, major earquakes, and tectonic plate mapping with various styles and colors were used to make the data mor presentable.

# MappingEarthquakes

Earthquake data was used to visualize information on a map.  Using Leaflet.js API and GeoJSON earthquake data we can provide a visual representation of data on a map for easier viewing.  

##  Deliverables
To add the tectonic plate data to the map, an additional tile layer was added using the L.tileLayer function amd GEOJSON linestrings. The d3.json() method was used to call, read, and parse the data using a URL provided from GitHub.  Major Earthquake data was added to the map in similar function. However, circles were used as markers instead of lines.  The final and third deliverable wasto include an additional map option (dark) to the map.  In addition to the streets and satellite tilelayers in our code, we made a dark tilelayer, using the leaflet.js API.
